# Zip-cracker-script
A zip, rar &amp; .7z password-protected file bypass script tool. 

- NOTE:- ```Using large data wordlists like rockyou.txt may take longer and you may want to break down your data to less large wordlists```
- I've also added a wordlist fixer script incase of any errors with your wordlist
### Steps
- Download the rockyou.txt wordlist from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt then add it to your project.
- You can also create your own wordlist based on the passwords used.
- Add the password-protected zip file to your project
- Run the script file on your text editor of choice
